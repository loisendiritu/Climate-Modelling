# The Naked Planet Climate Model
The temperature of a planet is determined by balancing energy fluxes into and out of a planet.  Incoming solar heat is determined by L * (1-albedo) / 4, and outgoing infrared is calculated as epsilon * sigma * T^4.
The goal is to numerically simulate how the planetary temperature of a naked planet would change through time as it approaches equilibrium (the state at which it stops changing).  The planet starts with some initial temperature.  The “heat capacity” (units of Joules / m2 K) of the planet is set by a layer of water which absorbs heat and changes its temperature.  If the layer is very thick, it takes a lot more heat (Joules) to change the temperature.
The heat content is related to the temperature by the heat capacity. The numerical method is to take time steps, extrapolating the heat content from one step to the next using the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes.
